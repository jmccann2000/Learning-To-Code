Lesson 000:

The first lesson is a dipping of the toe into the Python language waters. You must implement the
load_tokens_from_file_path function defined in the file_reader.py code module. Please refer to the code comments
in this code module for further instructions.

As these lessons progress, we will enhance and compose the previous lessons work to eventually produce a fully
functional new programming language called Jmac.
